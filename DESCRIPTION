Description: This package performs a comprehensive local sensitivity analysis of MCMC 
    output with respect to all input parameters (prior hyper-parameters and 
    starting values) to assess prior robustness and algorithm convergence in 
    models estimated via Gibbs samplers. 
    It extends the usual Automatic Differentiation to allow for differentiation of 
    matrix decomposition and random samples, and it exploits matrix and vector calculus results 
    to compute large sets of Jacobian matrices that contain the first order 
    derivatives of all MCMC draws with respect to all input parameters. 
    A range of sensitivity measures for posterior statistics can be computed, 
    such as prior robustness of posterior means and prediction intervals, 
    as well as algorithm convergence measures bases on starting value sensitivities.
