Description: This package allows for a comprehensive local sensitivity analysis of MCMC 
    output with respect to all input parameters (prior hyper-parameters and 
    starting values) to assess prior robustness and algorithm convergence in 
    models estimated via Gibbs samplers. It implements the forward method of 
    Automatic Differentiation and exploits matrix and vector calculus results 
    to compute large sets of Jacobian matrices that contain the first order 
    derivatives of all MCMC draws with respect to all input parameters. It 
    computes a range of sensitivity measures for posterior statistics such as 
    prior robustness of posterior means and prediction intervals, as well as 
    algorithm convergence measures bases on starting value sensitivities.
